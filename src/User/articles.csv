1,Scientists just grew the 1st-ever 'minibrains' from multiple people's cells,Chimeroids are 3D brain models grown from stem cells sourced from multiple individuals containing various cell types found in fetal brains. These hybrid creations are a variation of brain organoids 3D tissue models mimicking the structure and function of full-size brains. They offer greater biological accuracy compared to 2D cell models or animal studies like those using lab mice potentially accelerating drug research and development.
